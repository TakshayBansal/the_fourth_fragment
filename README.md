# The Fourth Fragment

*Your Mind Is A Trap* is an adventure-puzzle game that takes you on a psychological journey through the deepest corners of your mind, testing your resilience against confusion, anger, fear, and the illusions that deceive you.

## Storyline

You awaken to a chilling reality—your mind is shattered. Bewitched by a sinister witch, your brain has been divided into three fragments, each locked within nightmarish levels embodying the most harrowing emotions: *Confusion, Anger, and Fear*. To reclaim your sanity, you must navigate these treacherous trials, facing puzzles and enemies that test the very fabric of your consciousness.

But your journey doesn’t end there.

After triumphing over your fragmented mind, you stumble upon an entrancing captive—a beautiful girl held prisoner by a powerful guardian. Overcome with *desire*, you battle fiercely to rescue her, only to be betrayed in the most sinister twist: the girl is none other than the witch who bewitched you!

The truth is revealed—your mind was never broken into just three parts. There was a fourth, and it remains in her clutches. The final battle begins, as you must defeat the witch to reclaim the last piece of your mind.

But even victory is an illusion.

Upon defeating the witch, you discover a *time machine—an opportunity to rewrite your fate. You travel back in time, determined to prevent your past mistakes. Yet, in an eerie twist of fate, you find yourself face-to-face with your younger self… **who is now battling you to ‘rescue’ the girl.*

The cycle continues. There is no escape. *Your mind is the trap.*
